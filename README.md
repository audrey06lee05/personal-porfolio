# personal-porfolio

This is a website template I found in Envato Elements. The aim of making this personal portfolio is to gain my practical skills in reading and understanding code, as well as making a portfolio for myself. This porfolio has made me gained a lot of html skills, which allows me to customise the website more efficiently.

Progress:
The project is still in progress but I have added most of my experiences and background information to the website. Please click the html file in the html folder to view the website.
